All the migration command which is very important


## **Django Migrations: Apply & Rollback Commands**
Migrations help manage database schema changes, but they can sometimes cause issues. Below are all the necessary commands for applying, rolling back, and fixing migration errors.

---

### **1. Apply Migrations**
#### **Apply all pending migrations**
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```
👉 This will apply all migrations for all installed apps.

#### **Apply migrations for a specific app**
```bash
python manage.py migrate app_name
```
👉 Replace `app_name` with your actual Django app name.

---

### **2. Check Migration Status**
```bash
python manage.py showmigrations
```
👉 This will show which migrations are applied (`[X]`) and which are pending (`[ ]`).

---

### **3. Make Migrations (Before Applying)**
If you made model changes and need to create migration files:
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
```
For a specific app:
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations app_name
```
👉 This generates migration files but does **not** apply them yet.

---

### **4. Rollback (Undo) Last Migration**
If you applied a migration but want to revert it:
```bash
python manage.py migrate app_name previous_migration
```
Example: If the last applied migration is `0003_auto_xyz.py` and you want to go back to `0002_auto_abc.py`:
```bash
python manage.py migrate app_name 0002
```
👉 This will **undo** `0003`.

---

### **5. Reset All Migrations (Delete and Reapply)**
🚨 **⚠ Use with caution! This deletes all migrations and starts fresh.**

#### **Delete Migration Files**
```bash
find . -path "*/migrations/*.py" -not -name "__init__.py" -delete
```
(For Windows, manually delete the `migrations/` folder inside each app, except `__init__.py`)

#### **Delete the Database (if needed)**
```bash
rm db.sqlite3
```
(For PostgreSQL/MySQL, drop the database manually)

#### **Recreate Migrations & Apply**
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

---

### **6. Fake Migrations (If Already Applied in DB)**
Sometimes, migrations cause errors because they were **already applied in the database but not recorded in Django**. In that case, use:
```bash
python manage.py migrate --fake
```
For a specific app:
```bash
python manage.py migrate app_name --fake
```

---

### **7. Squash Migrations (Optimize)**
Over time, too many migration files can slow down Django. To combine old migrations:
```bash
python manage.py squashmigrations app_name 0001 0005
```
👉 This will **merge** migrations `0001` to `0005` into a single file.

---

## **Common Migration Issues & Fixes**
### **❌ Issue 1: "Relation already exists"**
> **Fix:** Use `--fake-initial` when applying migrations:
```bash
python manage.py migrate --fake-initial
```

### **❌ Issue 2: "Table already exists"**
> **Fix:** Fake the migration OR delete and reapply.

### **❌ Issue 3: "Field cannot be null"**
> **Fix:** Provide a default value in the migration file OR add `null=True, blank=True` in the model.

---

### **🎯 Best Practices**
✅ Always run `makemigrations` before `migrate`.  
✅ Use `showmigrations` to check the migration status.  
✅ For major changes, **backup your database** before migrating.  
✅ Use `--fake` if migrations are already applied in the database but missing in Django.
